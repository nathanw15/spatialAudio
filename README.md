# allotemplate
Template for creating applications using allolib. This template is suitable for large projects wil multiple files and dependencies where you need more control. If you are prototyping single files or want to explore the allolib examples, use the [allolib_playground repo](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib_playground).

# Installation

## Dependencies

terminal to run bash

git

cmake version 3.0 or higher

## How to setup
On a bash shell:

    git clone https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allotemplate.git <project folder name>
    cd <project folder name>

    ./init.sh

Now the folder is no longer a git repository.

Make the project folder into the git repository of your choice.

Example: Converting the folder into a new github repository (replace username and repository name)

    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo
    git push -u origin master

After setting up the git repo, add allolib as a submodule from the root, and perform a recursive update/init

    git submodule add https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib.git
    git submodule update --recursive --init

## How to compile / run
src folder contains the initial test code you can replace.

Edit CMakeLists.txt and run.sh to match your code.

On a bash shell:

    ./configure.sh

This will execute cmake on the project

    ./run.sh

This will compile the project, and run the binary if compilation is successful.

## How to perform a distclean
If you need to delete the distribution,

    ./distclean.sh

should recursively clean all the build directories of the project including those of allolib and its submodules.
